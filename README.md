## Elastic Collision
Momentum is conserved but objects do not stick to each other in a collision. 
Formula for velocities: 
given that object A and B's mass are equal to m and M, respectively, and initial velocity of A and B is v and u,respectively
final velocity of A = (m - M)/(m+M) * v + 2M/(m+M) * u
final velocity of B = 2m/(m+M) * v + (M-m)/(m+M) * u
